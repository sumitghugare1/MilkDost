## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Client doesn't see deliveries:
- Check: Delivery has correct `clientId` (should match client's Firebase Auth UID)
- Check: Client is using `deliveryService.getByClientId()` method
- Check: Browser console for errors

### Client doesn't appear in Client Management:
- Check: Activation created document in `clients` collection
- Check: Document ID matches client's user ID
- Check: `userId` field points to owner's ID

### Bills calculation wrong:
- Check: All deliveries for that month have correct `clientId`
- Check: Client rate is correct (default ₹50 or edited value)
- Check: Quantity × Rate formula

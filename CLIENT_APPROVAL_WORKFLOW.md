# Client Approval & Management Workflow

## 🎯 Complete Integration Guide

### Overview
When a dairy owner approves a client account, the system now creates a **fully functional client record** that integrates with all tracking systems (deliveries, bills, payments).

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Client Registration
**Client Side:**
- Client registers at `/auth` page
- Selects role: **"Client"**
- Provides:
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Password
  - Phone Number
  - Address
  - **Dairy Owner ID** (owner's user ID)
- Account created with `isActive: false`
- Client sees: **"Account Inactive - Pending dairy owner approval"**

---

### 2. Owner Reviews Request
**Owner Side:**
- Login to owner account
- Navigate to **"Accounts"** tab (fourth icon in bottom navigation)
- See pending client in **"Pending Approval"** section
- View client details:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Address
  - Registration date

---

### 3. Owner Approves Client
**Owner Action:**
- Click **"Activate"** button on pending client
- System automatically:
  
  ✅ **User Profile Update:**
  - Sets `isActive: true` in `users` collection
  
  ✅ **Client Record Creation:**
  - Creates document in `clients` collection
  - Document ID = Client's Firebase Auth UID
  - Sets default values:
    ```javascript
    {
      id: clientUserId,
      userId: ownerId,              // Owner's ID
      name: "Client Name",
      email: "client@example.com",
      phone: "1234567890",
      address: "Client Address",
      milkQuantity: 1,              // Default: 1 liter
      deliveryTime: "07:00 AM",     // Default: 7 AM
      rate: 50,                      // Default: ₹50/liter
      isActive: true
    }
    ```
  
- **Success notification:** "Client account activated successfully"

---

### 4. Client Appears in Management
**Owner Dashboard:**

📍 **Client Management Page:**
- Approved client now visible in client list
- Can edit client details:
  - Milk quantity
  - Delivery time
  - Rate per liter
  - Contact info
  - Address

📍 **Available Actions:**
- ✏️ Edit client details
- 📦 Create deliveries
- 💳 Generate bills
- 💰 Record payments
- 🗑️ Delete client (if needed)

---

### 5. Creating Deliveries for Client
**Owner Workflow:**

1. Go to **"Deliveries"** tab
2. Click **"Add Delivery"** button
3. Select client from dropdown
4. Fill delivery details:
   - Date
   - Quantity (in liters)
   - Status (Delivered/Pending)
5. Save delivery

**Database Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "delivery123",
  userId: "ownerId",           // Owner who created it
  clientId: "clientUserId",     // Client it's for
  clientName: "Client Name",
  quantity: 2,
  date: "2024-01-15",
  status: "delivered",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

---

### 6. Generating Bills for Client
**Owner Workflow:**

1. Go to **"Billing"** tab
2. Click **"Generate Bill"**
3. Select:
   - Client
   - Month and Year
4. System automatically:
   - Fetches all deliveries for that client in that month
   - Calculates: `Total = Quantity × Rate`
   - Creates bill with due date

**Database Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: "bill123",
  userId: "ownerId",           // Owner who created it
  clientId: "clientUserId",     // Client it's for
  month: 1,
  year: 2024,
  totalQuantity: 60,           // Sum of all deliveries
  totalAmount: 3000,           // totalQuantity × rate
  isPaid: false,
  dueDate: "2024-02-10",
  deliveries: ["delivery1", "delivery2", ...],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

---

### 7. Client Dashboard Access
**Client Side:**

After approval, client logs in and sees:

📊 **Dashboard Statistics:**
- Total Bills
- Paid Bills
- Unpaid Bills
- Total Spent
- Pending Amount
- Recent Deliveries (last 7 days)

📦 **Recent Deliveries:**

## 🔗 Data Linking Structure

### How Data Connects:

```
Owner (userId: "owner123")
    │
    ├── creates Client (id: "client456", userId: "owner123")
    │
    ├── creates Delivery (
    │       userId: "owner123",      ← Owner who created
    │       clientId: "client456"    ← Client it's for
    │   )
    │
    ├── creates Bill (
    │       userId: "owner123",      ← Owner who created
    │       clientId: "client456"    ← Client it's for
    │   )
    │
    └── records Payment (
            userId: "owner123",      ← Owner who received
            clientId: "client456"    ← Client who paid
        )

Client (userId: "client456")
    │
    └── views data filtered by clientId: "client456"
```

## 💡 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: Why did you choose Next.js over React?**
> A: Next.js provides server-side rendering, better SEO, built-in routing, and optimized performance. It's also industry-standard for production apps.

**Q: Why Firebase instead of traditional backend?**
> A: Firebase offers real-time capabilities, easy authentication, and serverless architecture. It reduces development time and hosting costs while providing scalability.

**Q: How do you handle security?**
> A: We use Firebase Authentication for secure login, Firestore security rules for data access control, and role-based permissions. Passwords are never stored in plain text.

**Q: Is this mobile-friendly?**
> A: Yes! It's designed mobile-first with responsive layouts. It can also be installed as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on smartphones.

**Q: How do you handle offline scenarios?**
> A: Firebase has offline persistence capabilities. The app can queue operations and sync when connection is restored.

**Q: Can multiple dairy owners use this?**
> A: Yes, the architecture supports multi-tenancy. Each dairy owner has isolated data with their unique clients and records.

**Q: What about data backup?**
> A: Firebase automatically handles backups. We can also export data to JSON/CSV for local backup.

**Q: Payment gateway - is it live or test?**
> A: Currently in test mode with Razorpay test keys. For production, we'll use live API keys after verification.

**Q: Can this scale for large dairy farms?**
> A: Absolutely! Firebase scales automatically, and our optimized queries can handle thousands of clients.

**Q: What about milk quality tracking?**
> A: That's a planned feature! We can add fat content, SNF (Solids Not Fat), and quality parameters in future versions.

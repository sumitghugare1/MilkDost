## 🎓 Answer These Expected Questions

### Q: "How is data secured?"
**A:** "We use Firebase Authentication with role-based access control. Each user can only see their authorized data. Owner sees all clients, clients see only their own data."

### Q: "Is this real-time?"
**A:** "Yes! Using Firestore real-time listeners. When owner creates a delivery, client sees it immediately without refresh."

### Q: "Can it handle multiple clients?"
**A:** "Absolutely! Owner can manage unlimited clients. Each client record is isolated and filtered by clientId for data security."

### Q: "What if client forgets password?"
**A:** "Firebase Auth provides built-in password reset via email. We can add that feature in the auth page."

### Q: "How are bills calculated?"
**A:** "Automatically! System fetches all deliveries for selected month, sums quantities, multiplies by client's rate. Owner just clicks 'Generate Bill'."

### Q: "Can this scale?"
**A:** "Yes! Firebase Firestore is production-ready, handles millions of documents. Current architecture supports multiple dairy owners with hundreds of clients each."

### Q: "Mobile support?"
**A:** "Fully responsive! Bottom tab navigation for mobile. Same code works on desktop with proper layouts."
